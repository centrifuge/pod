Creating a new system for the global financial supply chain is only possible through the collaboration of a global ecosystem and community of companies, groups, organizations, and individuals. 
We want to come together to exchange ideas and build Centrifuge as an inclusive, welcoming, and safe community of collaborators, operators, investors, and users. Harmful or discriminating behavior by anyone will not be tolerated.

Community members should be judged by their actions, not criteria such as age, race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, disability, physical appearance, religion (or lack thereof), degrees, geographic location, or position.

## Be Open
Be welcoming to all. Especially welcome newcomers to the community. Everyone brings a different background and experiences to contribute to the systems and tools we want to build and use in the future. Great things can happen when we show up with an open mind and curiosity.

## Be Respectful
Be kind to others. Respect their work, time, and perspectives. Do not insult or put down community members. Respect each other and respect the challenges we are facing as individuals and a community.

## Build With Purpose
Always build for the user. Make public data available, protect private data, and create secure systems. Scalability is important. Promote Decentralization. We are building global systems for enterprise-scale deployments.


## Contribute
Contributions to the codebase, network, systems, online or offline materials, events, documentation, the overall knowledge base, and other community business are always welcome. Acceptance criteria for contributions will vary depending on the circumstances but we aim for a low barrier of entry for contributors.

## Bugs & Vulnerabilities
If you believe you have found a bug or vulnerability, please submit a report to the appropriate individual, team, or project right away. Make a good faith effort not to access or destroy data of others. Act for the common good through the prompt reporting of all found vulnerabilities. Never willfully exploit others without their permission.

## Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. 

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion (or lack thereof), level of ability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation or stalking; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcomed sexual attention.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including organizers and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.
